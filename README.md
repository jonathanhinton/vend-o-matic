# Vend-O-Matic
This app tests endpoints with HTTP methods through the ExpressJS framework. You will need NodeJS on your machine to run the code. Once installed, clone the repo then run 
```npm install```

From the project root directory run `node index.js` to get the server running.

I used [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) for testing all of the endpoints. I plan on adding a UI element to it in order to run the same tests independent of Postman.
